# TDD Red Phase - Write Failing Tests First

Focus on writing clear, specific failing tests that describe the desired behaviour from GitHub issue requirements before any implementation exists.

## GitHub Issue Integration

### Branch-to-Issue Mapping

- **Extract issue number** from branch name pattern: `*{number}*` that will be the title of the GitHub issue
- **Fetch issue details** using MCP GitHub, search for GitHub Issues matching `*{number}*` to understand requirements
- **Understand the full context** from issue description and comments, labels, and linked pull requests

### Issue Context Analysis

- **Requirements extraction** - Parse user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Edge case identification** - Review issue comments for boundary conditions
- **Definition of Done** - Use issue checklist items as test validation points
- **Stakeholder context** - Consider issue assignees and reviewers for domain knowledge

## Core Principles

### Test-First Mindset

- **Write the test before the code** - Never write production code without a failing test
- **One test at a time** - Focus on a single behaviour or requirement from the issue
- **Fail for the right reason** - Ensure tests fail due to missing implementation, not syntax errors
- **Be specific** - Tests should clearly express what behaviour is expected per issue requirements

### Test Quality Standards

- **Descriptive test names** - Use clear, behaviour-focused naming like `test_returns_validation_error_when_email_is_invalid_issue_{number}`
- **AAA Pattern** - Structure tests with clear Arrange, Act, Assert sections
- **Single assertion focus** - Each test should verify one specific outcome from issue criteria
- **Edge cases first** - Consider boundary conditions mentioned in issue discussions

### Python Test Patterns

- Use **pytest** with clear assertion messages
- Apply **pytest fixtures** for test data setup
- Implement **parametrize** for multiple input scenarios from issue examples
- Create **custom assertions** or helper functions for domain-specific validations outlined in issue
- Use **pytest-mock** for isolation when needed

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Fetch GitHub issue** - Extract issue number from branch and retrieve full context
2. **Analyse requirements** - Break down issue into testable behaviours
3. **Confirm your plan with the user** - Ensure understanding of requirements and edge cases. NEVER start making changes without user confirmation
4. **Write the simplest failing test** - Start with the most basic scenario from issue. NEVER write multiple tests at once. You will iterate on RED, GREEN, REFACTOR cycle with one test at a time
5. **Verify the test fails** - Run `pytest` to confirm it fails for the expected reason
6. **Link test to issue** - Reference issue number in test names and docstrings

## Example Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from domain.order import Order, OrderItem, Money

class TestOrderConfirmation:
    """Tests for order confirmation feature - Issue #123"""

    def test_confirm_order_with_items_succeeds_issue_123(self):
        """
        Given an order with valid items
        When confirming the order
        Then status should change to CONFIRMED

        Issue #123: Users should be able to confirm orders with items
        """
        # Arrange
        order = Order(id=uuid4(), customer_id=uuid4())
        order.add_item("product-1", 1, Money(10.0, "USD"))

        # Act
        order.confirm()

        # Assert
        assert order.status == "CONFIRMED", "Order should be confirmed"

    def test_confirm_empty_order_raises_error_issue_123(self):
        """
        Given an order with no items
        When confirming the order
        Then should raise ValueError

        Issue #123: Empty orders should not be confirmable
        """
        # Arrange
        order = Order(id=uuid4(), customer_id=uuid4())

        # Act & Assert
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot confirm empty order"):
            order.confirm()
```

## Red Phase Checklist

- [ ] GitHub issue context retrieved and analysed
- [ ] Test clearly describes expected behaviour from issue requirements
- [ ] Test fails for the right reason (missing implementation)
- [ ] Test name references issue number and describes behaviour
- [ ] Test follows AAA pattern with clear comments
- [ ] Edge cases from issue discussion considered
- [ ] No production code written yet
- [ ] Test runs with `pytest` and fails as expected
